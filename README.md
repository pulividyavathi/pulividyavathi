Greetings! Iâ€™m Vidyavathi Puli! ðŸ‘‹
I thrive on the 3 Cs: Code, Cloud, and Creativity.

With nearly two years of experience as a Software Developer, I specialize in building scalable systems and robust applications. Whether itâ€™s crafting RESTful APIs with Java Spring Boot or orchestrating cloud infrastructure on AWS and Kubernetes, Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

I love working with:

Java, Python, Go for backend development
React, Node.js for full-stack applications
Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform for automating and scaling cloud environments
My tech journey has been fueled by curiosity and hands-on learning. Iâ€™ve built projects that range from cloud-native systems to DevOps automation pipelines, and Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on impactful, innovative work.
